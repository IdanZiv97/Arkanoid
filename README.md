# Arkanoid
The Arkanoid (Brick Breaker) game implemented in Java. Coded using OOP concepts such as design patterns (Factory, Observer/Listener), polymorphism &amp; interfaces, inheritance, and more.

Created as a project in Introduction to OOP on my 1st year, second semester at Bar-Ilan University.
